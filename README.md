# ShinyCAS
Example R code using the SAS Swat package administration
This code is functional but not efficient at this time. That said, it is good demonstration code and a good place to start when integrating SAS Viya CAS funcitons through the R Swat package using Shiny reactivity.

I know that there are some problems with consistency, and one major todo is associated with making the code more in line with best practices.
